Dotfiles
========

Hi thanks for checking out my dotfiles. Within this repository you are able to
see a little preview of how I have configured the tools that I use everyday to
make my work more efficient and effective. I have my more private configurations
within a private repository but you'll be able to get a pretty good idea of my
workflow from this.
